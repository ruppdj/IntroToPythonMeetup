# IntroToPythonMeetup

To make tonight easer we will be using google labs to run jupyter notebooks. Click on the link here and make a copy of the notebook so you can run it your self.  [Here is the notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1t4WcCmwtEInkJrtIG04xWZxbHoPXI4p0)
You can also click on `Open in Playground` but will not ahve access to the notebook later.

If you would like you can download the repo from github [here](https://github.com/ruppdj/IntroToPythonMeetup)
